Agent managing stock investments
This is work in progress. main.py defines agents and their interactions. util.py includes functions/tools to measure portfolio risk and adjust the portfolio allocation and compute returns that agents are using.
There are two input files with stock data and fundamental data. You need to point to their location in the main.py
